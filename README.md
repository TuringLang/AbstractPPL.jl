# AbstractPPL.jl

A new light-weight package to factor out interfaces and associated APIs for probabilistic
programming languages (especially their modelleing languages).  The overall goals are creating an
abstract type and minimal set of functions that will be supported all model and trace types.  Some
other commonly used code, such as variable names, can also go here.
